                        <p>Following the 6.3 magnitude earthquake on 3 November 2025 in northern Afghanistan, the National Disaster Management Information System (NDMIS) reported 2,527 affected families across five provinces, with the highest impact in Balkh and Samangan and a lower impact in Kunduz, Jawzjan, and Sari Pul. To date, 25 fatalities (13 men, 6 women, 6 children) and 970 injuries have been recorded, and over 2,527 houses destroyed including 276 in Khulm District, Samangan. A mountain landslide briefly blocked the Balkh–Kabul highway in Tangi Tashqurghan valley, but the road has now been cleared and reopened.</p>
<p>The current disaster compounds Afghanistan’s broader crises, with more than 2.23 million returns from Iran and Pakistan since January 2025 and widespread economic hardship. With the approaching winter season, many remain without safe shelter, underscoring the urgent need for immediate lifesaving support. According to IOM’s Afghanistan Climate Vulnerability Assessment (ACVA) Round 2 report (<a href=""https://dtm.iom.int/reports/afghanistan-climate-vulnerability-assessment-round-2-q1-2025?close=true"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>Afghanistan Climate Vulnerability Assessment - Round 2 (Q1 2025) | Displacement Tracking Matrix</em></a>, the earthquake affected districts across Samangan and Balkh provinces hosted an estimated 220,311 people (52% male and 48% female), including 9,129 internally displaced persons (IDPs), 12,032 IDP returnees, and over 16,404 returnees from abroad in highly vulnerable conditions prior to the earthquake.</p>
<p>Pre-existing gender norms and restrictions on women’s mobility, education, and employment continue to limit their access to humanitarian and earthquake-related information. Women’s systematic exclusion from community engagement and decision-making, combined with limited female aid worker involvement and restrictions on male workers consulting women, increases protection risks, including sexual exploitation and abuse. Multi-sector rapid assessments in Marmul and Sholgareh (Balkh) highlight inadequate shelter exposing women, children, and persons with disabilities (PwDs) to heightened risks, limited food assistance, and low access to health services for remote and displaced households, including pregnant and lactating women (PLW), elderly, and those with chronic/serious medical conditions.</p>",https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/iom-flash-update-3-earthquake-northern-afghanistan-09-november-2025,"Mon, 10 Nov 2025 06:18:05 +0000"

<p>Hurricane Melissa, the most powerful storm to strike Jamaica since 1988, caused widespread disruption to food systems, social services, and access to safe water and sanitation. Severe impacts are confirmed across Hanover, Manchester, St. Elizabeth, St. James, Trelawny and Westmoreland, including extensive flooding, landslides, collapsed roofs, hospital and school damage, and prolonged power and communication outages.</p>
<ul><li>More than 30 communities remain inaccessible by road, with relief operations continuing by air. Electricity, water, telecommunication services and internet connectivity are still unavailable in the most affected parishes, while approximately 380,000 residents remain without electricity, mainly in the western parishes.</li>
<li>446 schools, serving approximately 150,000 students, are experiencing significant disruption according to the Prime Minister during his address to Parliament on November 6.</li>
<li>As of November 4, approximately 350 people were sheltering in the 14 government facilities that remain open.</li>
<li>UNICEF is distributing over 47 tons of supplies, supporting life-saving health interventions, psychosocial support, nutrition and safe water and sanitation. Supplies distributed as of November 7 will reach 40,000 school-aged children. This also includes water storage for 9,500 persons, water trucking initiated with the delivery of potable water to the Cornwall Regional Hospital in St. James, benefiting over 600 patients and health care workers.</li>

For families already living on the edge, the latest climate shocks brought immediate, devastating loss.</p>
<p>In the Al-Dhahi village of Raymah governorate, 46-year-old Husna—a widow, mother, and sole provider—watched on in horror as the storm stole their last piece of security. ""When the roof fell, everything we had was gone. We were left with nothing."" she recalled. The collapse of her single-room home not only destroyed their few possessions, but instantly plunged Husna and her three young daughters into destitution. Although neighbours offered Husna and her family temporary shelter, she insisted on staying close to the remains of her home that first night. “It was all we had left,” she explained softly. “I couldn’t bear to leave it.”</p>
<p><strong>Weathering the storm: Climate shocks hit the most vulnerable</strong></p>
<p>Since the loss of her husband four years ago, Husna has shouldered the responsibility of providing for her family by collecting and selling charcoal for a meager, unreliable income. She belongs to the rising tide of Yemeni women leading displaced households—<a href=""https://yemen.un.org/en/293212-unfpa-yemen-opening-safe-spaces-filled-new-possibilities-displaced-women-and-girls"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>a quarter of all displaced families are now headed by women</strong></a>, a staggering jump from just 9 percent before the 2015 conflict escalation.</p>
<p>In Sana'a Governorate, 45-year-old Younes and his family had already been ripped from their home by the long crisis. They eventually settled in Al-Suweida Camp, where life was unforgiving for his children: worn-out tents, no electricity, and no schools. When heavy rains struck in August 2025, the floodwaters ruined their tent and soaked their few remaining possessions, forcing the family to huddle together in the cold and rain.</p>
<p><strong>The Rapid Response Mechanism: A critical first line of defence</strong></p>
<p>Relief arrived for Husna and Younes through the Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM), a crucial first line of defence led by UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, in coordination with WFP and UNICEF, funded by <a href=""https://civil-protection-humanitarian-aid.ec.europa.eu/what/humanitarian-aid_en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>ECHO, the European Union Humanitarian Aid.</strong></a> ​​The RRM provides immediate, life-saving assistance to people displaced by conflict or climate disasters, including ready-to-eat food, basic hygiene items, and women’s dignity kits, while also triggering referrals and multipurpose cash assistance where feasible–all within 48 to 72 hours.</p>
<p>“The food gave us strength after days without eating,” Husna said. “The soap and water filter meant I could finally protect my daughters from sickness. It was like breathing again after suffocating.” Younes also shared his relief when he received food, hygiene items and clothes, knowing his children could finally sleep peacefully after days of suffering.</p>
<p><strong>Under Threat: Funding shortfall endangers a lifeline</strong></p>
<p>Since 2018, the RRM has assisted nearly five million people, with over <a href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-rapid-response-mechanism-first-line-response-rrm-quarterly-snapshot-july-sept-2025""><strong>300,000 supported in 2025</strong></a> alone as climate shocks drive more than 80 per cent of all new displacements in Yemen. Crucially, the data collected when people receive RRM kits is leveraged to guide subsequent food, sanitation, and shelter responses, directly ensuring efficiency and impact.</p>
<p>This life-saving aid, however, is now under threat. As of October 2025, the RRM has only received 9 per cent of the $16.6 million needed to operate in 2025. The current funding gap jeopardizes the ability to deploy teams at full capacity within the critical 72-hour window and replenish buffer stocks.</p>
<p>“Investing in this mechanism ensures life-saving aid—including dignity kits, hygiene supplies, and food—reaches displaced men, women, and children within the critical 72-hour window, preserving the dignity and survival of Yemen's most vulnerable,” said Mr. Mustafa Elkanzi, UNFPA’s Acting Representative in Yemen. “The consequences of inaction are dire: without immediate support, the hard-won progress of years will be undone, abandoning those most in need to even greater peril.”</p>
<p>UNFPA and its partners urge the international community to urgently scale up flexible, timely, and predictable funding to close the critical resource gap for the RRM.</p>",https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/rapid-response-mechanism-yemens-emergency-lifeline-under-threat,"Mon, 10 Nov 2025 03:52:45 +0000"

                        <h2>Somalia: Thousands of climate-displaced individuals being failed by authorities and the international community – new report</h2>
<p>Somali authorities and the international community have repeatedly failed to protect thousands of people from drought-affected communities in southern Somalia, exposing them to violations of their rights to food, water, family, health and life, Amnesty International said in a new report.</p>
<p><em>‘</em><a href=""https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr52/0459/2025/en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><em><strong>No rain, no food, no animals: The human rights impact of drought and displacement in Somalia</strong></em></a><em>’</em> documents how, between 2020 and 2023, climate change-related drought, coupled with conflict and marginalization, forced thousands of people to relocate to camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs) initially in southern Somalia and then to Dadaab Refugee Camp in Kenya. During these arduous journeys, the Somali authorities failed to provide relief, including health services and food.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Somalia is on the frontline of human-induced climate change. As the seventh most climate-vulnerable country in the world, Somalia’s authorities, with the support of the international community, must urgently address the marginalization of communities in southern Somalia who are acutely impacted by global warming caused mainly by fossil fuel combustion</strong></p>
<p>Tigere Chagutah, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for East and Southern Africa</p>

<p>“Somalia is on the frontline of human-induced climate change. As the seventh most climate-vulnerable country in the world, Somalia’s authorities, with the support of the international community, must urgently address the marginalization of communities in southern Somalia who are acutely impacted by global warming caused mainly by fossil fuel combustion, said Tigere Chagutah, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for East and Southern Africa region.</p>
<p>“Somalia’s contribution to global warming is negligible, yet its people are bearing the brunt of the climate crisis, while also facing long running conflict and poverty. High income countries, especially those most responsible for climate change, must step in and meet their obligations to support Somalia in adapting to the effects of climate change.”</p>
<p>The report is based on interviews carried out between September 2024 and March 2025, with 177 people displaced into Dadaab Refugee Camp. Amnesty also interviewed emergency service providers, humanitarian workers, government officials, and climate change experts who either work in Somalia or have knowledge and experience of the country’s vulnerabilities to drought and climate change.</p>
<p><strong>“Everything dried up”</strong></p>
<p>Persistent drought in southern Somalia since 2022, made worse by human induced climate change, has combined with several other factors such as continued conflict to drive mass displacement. With water sources drying up, people have been forced to drink contaminated water, fostering the spread of water-borne diseases including cholera. The scarcity of local health facilities forced people to travel up to 1000km for treatment.</p>
<p>The drought also caused food prices to rise by up to 160% above pre-2020 levels across Somalia. This, coupled with depleted food stores, dry farmlands and reduced incomes, made food unavailable and inaccessible, resulting in rampant malnutrition and food insecurity, driving further displacement. The drought was eventually declared a national disaster in November, 2021.</p>
<p>Despite this growing health crisis, Somalia has failed to fulfil its human rights obligation to guarantee the rights of drought-affected individuals by not increasing its allocation to the health budget – which is currently less than 5% of overall government expenditure – to 15% as set out in the Abuja declaration, a commitment by African Union countries including Somalia to increase national health budgets.</p>
<p>“Limited resources and the ongoing conflict are not an excuse to neglect international obligations and necessary government action; Somalia erred by folding its hands. Having declared the drought a national disaster, authorities should have ensured there were enough resources to protect drought affected people, including by seeking extra international assistance,” said Tigere Chagutah.</p>
<p>Fadumo*, a 53-year-old mother of eight from Xabaalo Barbar in Baydhabo District, told Amnesty that after years of erratic rainfall and drought, she abandoned her farm and moved to an IDP camp in the capital Mogadishu because she had no food and water. The only available water, which was dirty and salty, was from a well 24 hours away on foot or donkey cart. After being unable to find work in Mogadishu, she moved to Dadaab.</p>
<p>Amnesty found that the Somali authorities failed to prevent family separation and the abandonment of children, older people and people with medical conditions during drought-induced displacement.</p>
<p>Bile*, a 33-year-old farmer and father of eight from Fargarow in Jilib, explained how his parents died after he had to move to Dadaab:</p>
<p>“When the drought came, everything dried up. I had eight children, a wife and my parents who were old and relied on me. So, when the drought came, we quickly finished the food that we had stored. I decided to move with my children and wife in 2023. However, since I was their only provider, my parents succumbed to the famine after I left them in Jilib.”</p>
<p>Due to the lack of early warning systems, floods also destroyed grains stored underground resulting in even greater food insecurity during the drought.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>“The Somali authorities must urgently come up with climate change resilience policies that also address the resulting loss and damage as witnessed among the most vulnerable communities in southern and central Somalia,” said Tigere Chagutah.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple displacements</strong></p>
<p>Many IDPs said they had been displaced more than once, initially into IDP camps or informal settlements within southern Somalia, where some government services were available and some NGOs were present. However, with many of these sites located in areas of high climate vulnerability, further displacements occurred due to drought or floods.</p>
<p>As the number of IDPs in southern Somalia soared, humanitarian actors lacked adequate resources to address their needs, forcing IDPs to move to Dadaab.</p>
<p>The journey to Dadaab on the Somalia-Kenya border is long and arduous. Depending on the mode of transport it can take anywhere between two days to six weeks. Those with resources could board or hire vehicles. However, the fares are exorbitant and out of reach for many, with some families telling Amnesty International that they had to sell household items, livestock, grains or even land to afford fares.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Having declared the drought a national disaster, authorities should have ensured there were enough resources to protect drought affected people, including by seeking extra international assistance.</strong></p>
<p>Tigere Chagutah</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Services from humanitarian organizations and government departments along the transport routes were largely absent, with the limited assistance available appearing to be centralized around settlements and IDP camps and not along transport corridors. This is despite Somalia’s obligations under its constitution and international law, including under the Kampala Convention, to protect those displaced by climate change.</p>
<p>Abdullahi, who travelled from Saakow in Somalia to Dadaab, said:</p>
<p>“When we got to Dhobley, well-wishers picked 15 women and children and gave them a lift in their vehicle to Dadaab. The men were left behind to walk with the donkey carts. We carried sorghum [a type of grain] and water for the children, but they were extremely malnourished on arrival because what we had only lasted a few days.”</p>",https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/no-rain-no-food-no-animals-human-rights-impact-drought-and-displacement-somalia,"Mon, 10 Nov 2025 03:48:51 +0000"

                        <p><strong>Situation Overview &amp; Humanitarian Needs</strong></p>
<p>As of October 2025, Burundi continues to face a complex humanitarian crisis, driven by a massive influx of Congolese refugees that began in February 2025. This situation is compounded by the lingering effects of the 2024 floods and ongoing outbreaks of Mpox, cholera, and measles. Epidemiological data from late October confirms active transmission, with 134 new cholera cases reported in week 44 and 21 new Mpox cases in week 42, where 21 cases remained hospitalized.</p>
<p>The refugee crisis is significant. As of October 30, 2025, Burundi hosts 35,828 refugees from the recent conflict in the DRC, 53% of whom are children. The population is distributed as follows: 15,478 are at the Musenyi site in Burunga Province (formerly Rutana), over 15,800 are with host families in Cibitoke Province, and more than 4,500 remain in transit sites and border areas. These groups face severe challenges, with limited access to essential services including clean water, sanitation, primary healthcare, psychosocial support, education, shelter, and nonfood items.</p>
<p>A second major development occurred in October 2025, when UNHCR shared information on the Tanzanian government's decision to close camps hosting Burundian refugees. On 1617October, 2025, the Government of Tanzania notified the refugee community of the closure of Nduta camp by March 31, 2026, and the Burundian section of the Nyarugusu camp by June 30, 2026. These two camps host over 150,000 Burundian refugees. The massive return of these individuals, which began this week, represents a critical point of focus for the humanitarian community, which is now actively implementing Contingency and Response Plans to address this new wave of needs.</p>",https://reliefweb.int/report/burundi/unicef-burundi-humanitarian-situation-report-no-14-october-2025,"Mon, 10 Nov 2025 03:31:12 +0000"

<p>This document provides an update to the Cold Spot Risk Assessment for the winter season 2025/2026 in Ukraine. The initial assessment was published in May 2025.</p>
<p>The war in Ukraine has driven displacement, and led to the destruction of housing and energy, water and transportation infrastructure. These affect both individual and societal resilience to cold weather.</p>
<p>This assessment identifies “cold spots” where winter-related hazards compound with high levels of exposure, susceptibility, and reduced coping capacity. These factors are dynamic, changing year by year as the conflict continues. The update takes this into account by using newly available population estimates and conflict monitoring data.</p>
<p>As noted in the May edition of the index, flexible and adaptive interventions are necessary to respond to potential further deterioration of the energy infrastructure and emerging localized challenges in other areas of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Continuous monitoring, as well as engagement with local authorities and communities can help address the evolving needs and challenges faced by affected populations during the winter season.</p>",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-cold-spot-risk-assessment-20252026-autumn-update-factsheet-november-2025,"Mon, 10 Nov 2025 03:15:40 +0000"

<p><strong>WASHINGTON, 7 de noviembre de 2025</strong> — Tras el paso del huracán Melissa, el Gobierno de Jamaica recibirá un desembolso total de USD 150 millones bajo su cobertura de seguro contra catástrofes que tiene con el Banco Mundial, respaldada por un bono para catástrofes emitido en 2024 por el Banco Mundial (Banco Internacional de Reconstrucción y Fomento -BIRF, calificación AAA/Aaa).</p>
<p>El análisis realizado por la empresa independiente <em>AIR Worldwide Corporation</em>, agente de cálculo de este instrumento, concluyó que el huracán Melissa alcanzó los parámetros preacordados que activan el pago total del bono catastrófico del Banco Mundial, el cual brinda a Jamaica protección financiera frente a desastres naturales específicos. El análisis se realizó con base en la presión central y la trayectoria de la tormenta reportadas por el Centro Nacional de Huracanes.</p>
<p>Jamaica, uno de los países más expuestos a los desastres naturales, cuenta con una sólida estrategia de financiamiento del riesgo de desastres. Inicialmente, Jamaica obtuvo cobertura de seguro frente a tormentas nombradas a través de un bono catastrófico emitido por el Banco Mundial en 2021, y tres años después renovó dicha cobertura mediante el <a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2024/04/25/world-bank-returns-to-the-cat-bond-market-providing-financial-protection-to-jamaica"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">bono emitido en 2024</a>. Puede encontrarse más información sobre la estructura del bono <a href=""https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/401877c87631461af8ad227793affc5f-0340012025/original/Case-Study-Jamaica-2024-Cat-Bond.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">aquí</a>.</p>
<p>Los bonos catastróficos transfieren el riesgo financiero de los desastres naturales a los mercados de capitales internacionales y son uno de los diversos instrumentos disponibles para apoyar a los países frente a desastres naturales como huracanes y terremotos. Estos bonos son reconocidos por las agencias calificadoras de riesgo por sus beneficios para los países y forman parte de sus herramientas de gestión del riesgo de desastres.</p>
<p>“Nuestros pensamientos están con el pueblo de Jamaica mientras avanza en su recuperación y reconstrucción tras esta tragedia. La estrategia integral de gestión del riesgo de desastres de Jamaica y su enfoque proactivo constituyen un modelo para otros países que enfrentan amenazas similares y buscan fortalecer su resiliencia financiera ante desastres naturales”, señaló <strong>Jorge Familiar</strong>, vicepresidente y tesorero del Banco Mundial. “Este desembolso pone de relieve el papel eficaz de los bonos catastróficos en las estrategias de gestión del riesgo y su eficiencia para transferir los riesgos de desastre a los mercados de capital”.</p>
<p>Además del desembolso total del bono catastrófico, el Grupo Banco Mundial está listo para movilizar un amplio paquete de apoyo para Jamaica —que combina financiamiento de emergencia de rápido desembolso, la reasignación de fondos de proyectos existentes, y apoyo específico al sector privado a través de la Corporación Financiera Internacional (IFC por sus siglas en inglés), el brazo de desarrollo del sector privado del Grupo Banco Mundial.</p>
<p>“Mientras Jamaica enfrenta las secuelas del huracán Melissa, su firme compromiso con la preparación está demostrando su valía, al permitir al país avanzar rápidamente de la respuesta a la reconstrucción, y aprovechar este momento no solo para reconstruir, sino para dar un salto hacia una infraestructura más resiliente”, afirmó <strong>Susana Cordeiro Guerra</strong>, vicepresidenta del Banco Mundial para América Latina y el Caribe. “El Grupo Banco Mundial está junto al Gobierno y el pueblo de Jamaica para apoyar una reconstrucción más sólida, restablecer los medios de vida y establecer un nuevo referente de resiliencia en el Caribe”.</p>
<p>El seguro contra catástrofes respaldado por bonos forma parte del conjunto de <a href=""https://www.bancomundial.org/es/news/factsheet/2024/02/01/world-bank-group-expands-its-crisis-toolkit-to-empower-countries-amid-intertwined-crises"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">herramientas para la preparación y respuesta frente a las crisis del Banco Mundial</a>, que ofrece a los países en desarrollo soluciones innovadoras para responder mejor a las crisis y fortalecer la preparación para conmociones futuras. Esto incluye acceso rápido a liquidez para la respuesta de emergencia, líneas de crédito, seguros y la posibilidad de pausar los pagos del servicio de la deuda tras un desastre natural.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Food assistance needs remain extremely high in South Sudan at the start of the harvest in October, with 8.0-8.99 million people (55-60 percent of the population) in need of assistance.</strong> While 1.6 million people received food and cash assistance monthly in the lean season, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse outcomes persist in 67 counties, eight of which are in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). The key drivers are conflict, flood, and economic shocks, as well as a sustained, high returnee presence. <a href=""https://www.ipcinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ipcinfo/docs/IPC_South_Sudan_Acute_Food_Insecurity_Malnutrition_Sept2025_July2026_Snapshot.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Global acute malnutrition</strong></a> (GAM) levels among children under five are very high, exceeding a 15 percent prevalence in 39 counties. As the main harvest begins, needs are expected to decline to 7.0-7.99 million through January, before rising again prior to the lean season.</li>
<li><strong>Nasir (Upper Nile) and Fangak (Jonglei) are of highest concern, with some populations still experiencing Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) in October.</strong> Concurrent conflict incidents and flooding have disrupted crop production and access to wild foods, while severely constraining humanitarian access. While food assistance distributions are ongoing and planned to continue, reaching the most acutely food insecure households in isolated areas remains challenging due to insecurity, which has driven humanitarians to rely on airdrops, particularly in southern Nasir. Some populations are expected to experience Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) through at least May.</li>
<li><strong>From October to May, Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes are expected to expand to 27</strong> <strong>counties.</strong> Levels of acute malnutrition are projected to surpass 15 percent GAM prevalence in 42 counties by May, with Extremely Critical levels expected in Nasir, Ulang, Baliet, Duk, Rubkona, and Abyei due to a combination of food and non-food factors. Food assistance is expected to prevent severe outcomes in eight areas, mapped in Crisis! (IPC Phase 3!).</li>

                        <h2>Key Messages</h2>
<ul><li><strong>Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected through May 2026 in conflict-affected areas of the north, with</strong> <strong>Stressed! (IPC Phase 2!) outcomes</strong> likely in Nangade and Muidumbe districts <strong>until February 2026</strong>, and in Macomia and Quissanga districts <strong>through April 2026</strong>, supported by ongoing humanitarian food assistance. However, non-state armed group (NSAG) attacks have intensified between July and September, causing renewed displacements of thousands of people, which further disrupts livelihoods, limits typical subsistence farming and income-earning activities. This persistent insecurity will likely contribute to localized below-average harvest starting in April 2026, limiting seasonal improvements in food security.</li>
<li><strong>From October 2025 until at least March 2026, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected in the southern and central semi-arid areas, following the 2025 below-average harvest.</strong> Households are expected to reduce meal frequency, prioritize feeding children, eating with relatives, consume more wild foods, and to some extent, withdrawing children from school, as households continue to face food consumption gaps. In April and May 2026, seasonal improvements to Stressed (IPC Phase 2) or Minimal (IPC Phase 1) outcomes are likely related to the harvest, leading to increased food consumption and income from crop sales.</li>
<li><strong>Conflict-affected areas of Cabo Delgado province and parts of Nampula province remain areas of highest concern.</strong> Ongoing attacks by NSAGs continue to displace populations, disrupt typical livelihood activities, destroy infrastructure, and hinder humanitarian access.</li>
<li><strong>FEWS NET estimates that 3.5-3.99 million people will require humanitarian food assistance</strong> during the peak of the lean season (January-March 2026). Increasing needs will primarily be due to the resurgence of conflict in Cabo Delgado, its expansion into neighboring Nampula Province, and the effects of two consecutive years of poor harvests in semi-arid areas caused by El Niño-induced droughts and subsequent minimal recovery. The total population in need includes those likely to be affected by potential climatic shocks during the 2025/26 rainy season, such as cyclones or floods.</li>
