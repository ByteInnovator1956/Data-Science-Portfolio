I was looking at the bloodlines and was wondering if there's anything looking good there for this class?

I was thinking that maybe losing Impact (AOE, dmg, accuracy) might be worth it in favor of the Delirious Bloodline. Specifically taking the Schizophrenia Dissociation node, which provides a whole **40% less damage taken from hits**.

The damage instead comes during the next 4 seconds. Which should be mitigated easily with the great life leech the build has.

My thinking is that both AOE, 15% damage, and accuracy are all nice to have, but nothing more. While 40% less damage taken from most damage sources is just huge.

No. Volcano does not in anyway log your personal information. Anybody saying it does is fabricated. I can prove this with a few points.

* Refer To Image 1: **12 to 12** (or dsds) was the original person providing statements that Volcano accessed your webcam upon external analysis. dsds however did not say that Volcano itself was malicious, or log information. The only people saying it did infact log information lied.
* Virustotal and Triage Scan: Using these two websites, we can identify that the only websites that Volcano accesses is [file.volcano.wtf](http://file.volcano.wtf), with the only purpose to get the Version file. This completely debunks the accusation of ""Volcano sending information to a remote server"" or ""Quietly collect your personal information"".
* WhatExploitsAreOnline: WEAO staff stated that the information may just be anti-debug, and even said that to stop calling Volcano malware.

**2. Whats with the Camera thing?**  
Volcano accessing your camera is likely just an anti-debug. Do you hear the whistle? We don't know for certain if this ""camera-flashing"" only happens for specific users. I can't completely defend Volcano though, because if this is an actual anti-tamper feature, that's immoral.

* Shouldn't this be associated with like, viruses and stuff?: No. Why would the camera only flash given only if debugged with a tool? If Volcano were malware, It would flash during regular usage, not just for people purposefully debugging it. This is also completely debunked by the 1st and 2nd point in Question 1.

That's really all I have to say, since no actual image or video proof was provided. Everything is based on hearsay and the points I have to debunk are very stale.

If you would like to provide some points, or counterarguments, please reply to the post.",volcano,"Keep in mind that following people's verdicts without any proof from them, and/or making your own verdict without explanation is stupid. Listen to your teachers, kids.

For families already living on the edge, the latest climate shocks brought immediate, devastating loss.</p>
<p>In the Al-Dhahi village of Raymah governorate, 46-year-old Husna—a widow, mother, and sole provider—watched on in horror as the storm stole their last piece of security. ""When the roof fell, everything we had was gone. We were left with nothing."" she recalled. The collapse of her single-room home not only destroyed their few possessions, but instantly plunged Husna and her three young daughters into destitution. Although neighbours offered Husna and her family temporary shelter, she insisted on staying close to the remains of her home that first night. “It was all we had left,” she explained softly. “I couldn’t bear to leave it.”</p>

They eventually settled in Al-Suweida Camp, where life was unforgiving for his children: worn-out tents, no electricity, and no schools. When heavy rains struck in August 2025, the floodwaters ruined their tent and soaked their few remaining possessions, forcing the family to huddle together in the cold and rain.</p>
<p><strong>The Rapid Response Mechanism: A critical first line of defence</strong></p>
<p>Relief arrived for Husna and Younes through the Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM), a crucial first line of defence led by UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, in coordination with WFP and UNICEF, funded by <a href=""https://civil-protection-humanitarian-aid.ec.europa.eu/what/humanitarian-aid_en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>ECHO, the European Union Humanitarian Aid.</strong></a> ​​The RRM provides immediate, life-saving assistance to people displaced by conflict or climate disasters, including ready-to-eat food, basic hygiene items, and women’s dignity kits, while also triggering referrals and multipurpose cash assistance where feasible–all within 48 to 72 hours.</p>
<p>“The food gave us strength after days without eating,” Husna said. “The soap and water filter meant I could finally protect my daughters from sickness. It was like breathing again after suffocating.” Younes also shared his relief when he received food, hygiene items and clothes, knowing his children could finally sleep peacefully after days of suffering.</p>
<p><strong>Under Threat: Funding shortfall endangers a lifeline</strong></p>
<p>Since 2018, the RRM has assisted nearly five million people, with over <a href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-rapid-response-mechanism-first-line-response-rrm-quarterly-snapshot-july-sept-2025""><strong>300,000 supported in 2025</strong></a> alone as climate shocks drive more than 80 per cent of all new displacements in Yemen.

<p>This life-saving aid, however, is now under threat. As of October 2025, the RRM has only received 9 per cent of the $16.6 million needed to operate in 2025. The current funding gap jeopardizes the ability to deploy teams at full capacity within the critical 72-hour window and replenish buffer stocks.</p>
<p>“Investing in this mechanism ensures life-saving aid—including dignity kits, hygiene supplies, and food—reaches displaced men, women, and children within the critical 72-hour window, preserving the dignity and survival of Yemen's most vulnerable,” said Mr. Mustafa Elkanzi, UNFPA’s Acting Representative in Yemen. “The consequences of inaction are dire: without immediate support, the hard-won progress of years will be undone, abandoning those most in need to even greater peril.”</p>

                        <h2>Somalia: Thousands of climate-displaced individuals being failed by authorities and the international community – new report</h2>
<p>Somali authorities and the international community have repeatedly failed to protect thousands of people from drought-affected communities in southern Somalia, exposing them to violations of their rights to food, water, family, health and life, Amnesty International said in a new report.</p>
<p><em>‘</em><a href=""https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr52/0459/2025/en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><em><strong>No rain, no food, no animals: The human rights impact of drought and displacement in Somalia</strong></em></a><em>’</em> documents how, between 2020 and 2023, climate change-related drought, coupled with conflict and marginalization, forced thousands of people to relocate to camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs) initially in southern Somalia and then to Dadaab Refugee Camp in Kenya. During these arduous journeys, the Somali authorities failed to provide relief, including health services and food.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Somalia is on the frontline of human-induced climate change. As the seventh most climate-vulnerable country in the world, Somalia’s authorities, with the support of the international community, must urgently address the marginalization of communities in southern Somalia who are acutely impacted by global warming caused mainly by fossil fuel combustion</strong></p>
<p>Tigere Chagutah, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for East and Southern Africa</p>

<p>“Somalia is on the frontline of human-induced climate change. As the seventh most climate-vulnerable country in the world, Somalia’s authorities, with the support of the international community, must urgently address the marginalization of communities in southern Somalia who are acutely impacted by global warming caused mainly by fossil fuel combustion, said Tigere Chagutah, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for East and Southern Africa region.</p>
<p>“Somalia’s contribution to global warming is negligible, yet its people are bearing the brunt of the climate crisis, while also facing long running conflict and poverty. High income countries, especially those most responsible for climate change, must step in and meet their obligations to support Somalia in adapting to the effects of climate change.”</p>
<p>The report is based on interviews carried out between September 2024 and March 2025, with 177 people displaced into Dadaab Refugee Camp. Amnesty also interviewed emergency service providers, humanitarian workers, government officials, and climate change experts who either work in Somalia or have knowledge and experience of the country’s vulnerabilities to drought and climate change.</p>
<p><strong>“Everything dried up”</strong></p>
<p>Persistent drought in southern Somalia since 2022, made worse by human induced climate change, has combined with several other factors such as continued conflict to drive mass displacement. With water sources drying up, people have been forced to drink contaminated water, fostering the spread of water-borne diseases including cholera. The scarcity of local health facilities forced people to travel up to 1000km for treatment.</p>
<p>The drought also caused food prices to rise by up to 160% above pre-2020 levels across Somalia. This, coupled with depleted food stores, dry farmlands and reduced incomes, made food unavailable and inaccessible, resulting in rampant malnutrition and food insecurity, driving further displacement. The drought was eventually declared a national disaster in November, 2021.</p>
<p>Despite this growing health crisis, Somalia has failed to fulfil its human rights obligation to guarantee the rights of drought-affected individuals by not increasing its allocation to the health budget – which is currently less than 5% of overall government expenditure – to 15% as set out in the Abuja declaration, a commitment by African Union countries including Somalia to increase national health budgets.</p>
<p>“Limited resources and the ongoing conflict are not an excuse to neglect international obligations and necessary government action; Somalia erred by folding its hands. Having declared the drought a national disaster, authorities should have ensured there were enough resources to protect drought affected people, including by seeking extra international assistance,” said Tigere Chagutah.</p>
<p>Fadumo*, a 53-year-old mother of eight from Xabaalo Barbar in Baydhabo District, told Amnesty that after years of erratic rainfall and drought, she abandoned her farm and moved to an IDP camp in the capital Mogadishu because she had no food and water. The only available water, which was dirty and salty, was from a well 24 hours away on foot or donkey cart. After being unable to find work in Mogadishu, she moved to Dadaab.</p>
<p>Amnesty found that the Somali authorities failed to prevent family separation and the abandonment of children, older people and people with medical conditions during drought-induced displacement.</p>
<p>Bile*, a 33-year-old farmer and father of eight from Fargarow in Jilib, explained how his parents died after he had to move to Dadaab:</p>
<p>“When the drought came, everything dried up. I had eight children, a wife and my parents who were old and relied on me. So, when the drought came, we quickly finished the food that we had stored. I decided to move with my children and wife in 2023. However, since I was their only provider, my parents succumbed to the famine after I left them in Jilib.”</p>
<p>Due to the lack of early warning systems, floods also destroyed grains stored underground resulting in even greater food insecurity during the drought.</p>

<p>Many IDPs said they had been displaced more than once, initially into IDP camps or informal settlements within southern Somalia, where some government services were available and some NGOs were present.

                        <h2>Somalia: Thousands of climate-displaced individuals being failed by authorities and the international community – new report</h2>
<p>Somali authorities and the international community have repeatedly failed to protect thousands of people from drought-affected communities in southern Somalia, exposing them to violations of their rights to food, water, family, health and life, Amnesty International said in a new report.</p>
<p><em>‘</em><a href=""https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr52/0459/2025/en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><em><strong>No rain, no food, no animals: The human rights impact of drought and displacement in Somalia</strong></em></a><em>’</em> documents how, between 2020 and 2023, climate change-related drought, coupled with conflict and marginalization, forced thousands of people to relocate to camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs) initially in southern Somalia and then to Dadaab Refugee Camp in Kenya. During these arduous journeys, the Somali authorities failed to provide relief, including health services and food.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Somalia is on the frontline of human-induced climate change. As the seventh most climate-vulnerable country in the world, Somalia’s authorities, with the support of the international community, must urgently address the marginalization of communities in southern Somalia who are acutely impacted by global warming caused mainly by fossil fuel combustion</strong></p>
<p>Tigere Chagutah, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for East and Southern Africa</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Somalia is on the frontline of human-induced climate change. As the seventh most climate-vulnerable country in the world, Somalia’s authorities, with the support of the international community, must urgently address the marginalization of communities in southern Somalia who are acutely impacted by global warming caused mainly by fossil fuel combustion, said Tigere Chagutah, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for East and Southern Africa region.</p>
<p>“Somalia’s contribution to global warming is negligible, yet its people are bearing the brunt of the climate crisis, while also facing long running conflict and poverty. High income countries, especially those most responsible for climate change, must step in and meet their obligations to support Somalia in adapting to the effects of climate change.”</p>
<p>The report is based on interviews carried out between September 2024 and March 2025, with 177 people displaced into Dadaab Refugee Camp. Amnesty also interviewed emergency service providers, humanitarian workers, government officials, and climate change experts who either work in Somalia or have knowledge and experience of the country’s vulnerabilities to drought and climate change.</p>
<p><strong>“Everything dried up”</strong></p>
<p>Persistent drought in southern Somalia since 2022, made worse by human induced climate change, has combined with several other factors such as continued conflict to drive mass displacement. With water sources drying up, people have been forced to drink contaminated water, fostering the spread of water-borne diseases including cholera. The scarcity of local health facilities forced people to travel up to 1000km for treatment.</p>
<p>The drought also caused food prices to rise by up to 160% above pre-2020 levels across Somalia. This, coupled with depleted food stores, dry farmlands and reduced incomes, made food unavailable and inaccessible, resulting in rampant malnutrition and food insecurity, driving further displacement. The drought was eventually declared a national disaster in November, 2021.</p>
<p>Despite this growing health crisis, Somalia has failed to fulfil its human rights obligation to guarantee the rights of drought-affected individuals by not increasing its allocation to the health budget – which is currently less than 5% of overall government expenditure – to 15% as set out in the Abuja declaration, a commitment by African Union countries including Somalia to increase national health budgets.</p>
<p>“Limited resources and the ongoing conflict are not an excuse to neglect international obligations and necessary government action; Somalia erred by folding its hands. Having declared the drought a national disaster, authorities should have ensured there were enough resources to protect drought affected people, including by seeking extra international assistance,” said Tigere Chagutah.</p>
<p>Fadumo*, a 53-year-old mother of eight from Xabaalo Barbar in Baydhabo District, told Amnesty that after years of erratic rainfall and drought, she abandoned her farm and moved to an IDP camp in the capital Mogadishu because she had no food and water. The only available water, which was dirty and salty, was from a well 24 hours away on foot or donkey cart. After being unable to find work in Mogadishu, she moved to Dadaab.</p>
<p>Amnesty found that the Somali authorities failed to prevent family separation and the abandonment of children, older people and people with medical conditions during drought-induced displacement.</p>
<p>Bile*, a 33-year-old farmer and father of eight from Fargarow in Jilib, explained how his parents died after he had to move to Dadaab:</p>
<p>“When the drought came, everything dried up. I had eight children, a wife and my parents who were old and relied on me. So, when the drought came, we quickly finished the food that we had stored. I decided to move with my children and wife in 2023. However, since I was their only provider, my parents succumbed to the famine after I left them in Jilib.”</p>
<p>Due to the lack of early warning systems, floods also destroyed grains stored underground resulting in even greater food insecurity during the drought.</p>

                        <p><strong>Situation Overview &amp; Humanitarian Needs</strong></p>
<p>As of October 2025, Burundi continues to face a complex humanitarian crisis, driven by a massive influx of Congolese refugees that began in February 2025. This situation is compounded by the lingering effects of the 2024 floods and ongoing outbreaks of Mpox, cholera, and measles. Epidemiological data from late October confirms active transmission, with 134 new cholera cases reported in week 44 and 21 new Mpox cases in week 42, where 21 cases remained hospitalized.</p>
<p>The refugee crisis is significant. As of October 30, 2025, Burundi hosts 35,828 refugees from the recent conflict in the DRC, 53% of whom are children. The population is distributed as follows: 15,478 are at the Musenyi site in Burunga Province (formerly Rutana), over 15,800 are with host families in Cibitoke Province, and more than 4,500 remain in transit sites and border areas. These groups face severe challenges, with limited access to essential services including clean water, sanitation, primary healthcare, psychosocial support, education, shelter, and nonfood items.</p>
<p>A second major development occurred in October 2025, when UNHCR shared information on the Tanzanian government's decision to close camps hosting Burundian refugees. On 1617October, 2025, the Government of Tanzania notified the refugee community of the closure of Nduta camp by March 31, 2026, and the Burundian section of the Nyarugusu camp by June 30, 2026. These two camps host over 150,000 Burundian refugees. The massive return of these individuals, which began this week, represents a critical point of focus for the humanitarian community, which is now actively implementing Contingency and Response Plans to address this new wave of needs.</p>",,,,,"<div class=""tag country"">Countries: Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, United Republic of Tanzania</div>

<p>This document provides an update to the Cold Spot Risk Assessment for the winter season 2025/2026 in Ukraine. The initial assessment was published in May 2025.</p>
<p>The war in Ukraine has driven displacement, and led to the destruction of housing and energy, water and transportation infrastructure. These affect both individual and societal resilience to cold weather.</p>
<p>This assessment identifies “cold spots” where winter-related hazards compound with high levels of exposure, susceptibility, and reduced coping capacity. These factors are dynamic, changing year by year as the conflict continues. The update takes this into account by using newly available population estimates and conflict monitoring data.</p>
<p>As noted in the May edition of the index, flexible and adaptive interventions are necessary to respond to potential further deterioration of the energy infrastructure and emerging localized challenges in other areas of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Continuous monitoring, as well as engagement with local authorities and communities can help address the evolving needs and challenges faced by affected populations during the winter season.</p>",,,,,"<div class=""tag country"">Country: Ukraine</div>

<p>The war in Ukraine has driven displacement, and led to the destruction of housing and energy, water and transportation infrastructure. These affect both individual and societal resilience to cold weather.</p>
<p>This assessment identifies “cold spots” where winter-related hazards compound with high levels of exposure, susceptibility, and reduced coping capacity. These factors are dynamic, changing year by year as the conflict continues. The update takes this into account by using newly available population estimates and conflict monitoring data.</p>
<p>As noted in the May edition of the index, flexible and adaptive interventions are necessary to respond to potential further deterioration of the energy infrastructure and emerging localized challenges in other areas of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Continuous monitoring, as well as engagement with local authorities and communities can help address the evolving needs and challenges faced by affected populations during the winter season.</p>",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-cold-spot-risk-assessment-20252026-autumn-update-factsheet-november-2025,"Mon, 10 Nov 2025 03:15:40 +0000"

<p><strong>WASHINGTON, 7 de noviembre de 2025</strong> — Tras el paso del huracán Melissa, el Gobierno de Jamaica recibirá un desembolso total de USD 150 millones bajo su cobertura de seguro contra catástrofes que tiene con el Banco Mundial, respaldada por un bono para catástrofes emitido en 2024 por el Banco Mundial (Banco Internacional de Reconstrucción y Fomento -BIRF, calificación AAA/Aaa).</p>
<p>El análisis realizado por la empresa independiente <em>AIR Worldwide Corporation</em>, agente de cálculo de este instrumento, concluyó que el huracán Melissa alcanzó los parámetros preacordados que activan el pago total del bono catastrófico del Banco Mundial, el cual brinda a Jamaica protección financiera frente a desastres naturales específicos. El análisis se realizó con base en la presión central y la trayectoria de la tormenta reportadas por el Centro Nacional de Huracanes.</p>
<p>Jamaica, uno de los países más expuestos a los desastres naturales, cuenta con una sólida estrategia de financiamiento del riesgo de desastres. Inicialmente, Jamaica obtuvo cobertura de seguro frente a tormentas nombradas a través de un bono catastrófico emitido por el Banco Mundial en 2021, y tres años después renovó dicha cobertura mediante el <a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2024/04/25/world-bank-returns-to-the-cat-bond-market-providing-financial-protection-to-jamaica"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">bono emitido en 2024</a>.

<p>Los bonos catastróficos transfieren el riesgo financiero de los desastres naturales a los mercados de capitales internacionales y son uno de los diversos instrumentos disponibles para apoyar a los países frente a desastres naturales como huracanes y terremotos. Estos bonos son reconocidos por las agencias calificadoras de riesgo por sus beneficios para los países y forman parte de sus herramientas de gestión del riesgo de desastres.</p>
<p>“Nuestros pensamientos están con el pueblo de Jamaica mientras avanza en su recuperación y reconstrucción tras esta tragedia. La estrategia integral de gestión del riesgo de desastres de Jamaica y su enfoque proactivo constituyen un modelo para otros países que enfrentan amenazas similares y buscan fortalecer su resiliencia financiera ante desastres naturales”, señaló <strong>Jorge Familiar</strong>, vicepresidente y tesorero del Banco Mundial. “Este desembolso pone de relieve el papel eficaz de los bonos catastróficos en las estrategias de gestión del riesgo y su eficiencia para transferir los riesgos de desastre a los mercados de capital”.</p>
<p>Además del desembolso total del bono catastrófico, el Grupo Banco Mundial está listo para movilizar un amplio paquete de apoyo para Jamaica —que combina financiamiento de emergencia de rápido desembolso, la reasignación de fondos de proyectos existentes, y apoyo específico al sector privado a través de la Corporación Financiera Internacional (IFC por sus siglas en inglés), el brazo de desarrollo del sector privado del Grupo Banco Mundial.</p>
<p>“Mientras Jamaica enfrenta las secuelas del huracán Melissa, su firme compromiso con la preparación está demostrando su valía, al permitir al país avanzar rápidamente de la respuesta a la reconstrucción, y aprovechar este momento no solo para reconstruir, sino para dar un salto hacia una infraestructura más resiliente”, afirmó <strong>Susana Cordeiro Guerra</strong>, vicepresidenta del Banco Mundial para América Latina y el Caribe. “El Grupo Banco Mundial está junto al Gobierno y el pueblo de Jamaica para apoyar una reconstrucción más sólida, restablecer los medios de vida y establecer un nuevo referente de resiliencia en el Caribe”.</p>

(IPC Phase 2!) outcomes</strong> likely in Nangade and Muidumbe districts <strong>until February 2026</strong>, and in Macomia and Quissanga districts <strong>through April 2026</strong>, supported by ongoing humanitarian food assistance. However, non-state armed group (NSAG) attacks have intensified between July and September, causing renewed displacements of thousands of people, which further disrupts livelihoods, limits typical subsistence farming and income-earning activities. This persistent insecurity will likely contribute to localized below-average harvest starting in April 2026, limiting seasonal improvements in food security.</li>
<li><strong>From October 2025 until at least March 2026, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected in the southern and central semi-arid areas, following the 2025 below-average harvest.</strong> Households are expected to reduce meal frequency, prioritize feeding children, eating with relatives, consume more wild foods, and to some extent, withdrawing children from school, as households continue to face food consumption gaps. In April and May 2026, seasonal improvements to Stressed (IPC Phase 2) or Minimal (IPC Phase 1) outcomes are likely related to the harvest, leading to increased food consumption and income from crop sales.</li>
<li><strong>Conflict-affected areas of Cabo Delgado province and parts of Nampula province remain areas of highest concern.</strong> Ongoing attacks by NSAGs continue to displace populations, disrupt typical livelihood activities, destroy infrastructure, and hinder humanitarian access.</li>
<li><strong>FEWS NET estimates that 3.5-3.99 million people will require humanitarian food assistance</strong> during the peak of the lean season (January-March 2026). Increasing needs will primarily be due to the resurgence of conflict in Cabo Delgado, its expansion into neighboring Nampula Province, and the effects of two consecutive years of poor harvests in semi-arid areas caused by El Niño-induced droughts and subsequent minimal recovery. The total population in need includes those likely to be affected by potential climatic shocks during the 2025/26 rainy season, such as cyclones or floods.</li>
