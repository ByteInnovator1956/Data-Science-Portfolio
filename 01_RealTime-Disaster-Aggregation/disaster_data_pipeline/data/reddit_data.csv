Reddit,wildfire,So ... Wildfire,"Thank you FS for the update, some nice stuff there. But ... could the Psyker talent *""Wildfire""* be improved? Right now it is more of a meme joke, especially when compared with Empyric Shock, Warp Splitting or Crack of Bone, depending on your build of course. But even for a Inferno build it is not exaactly great.

Perhaps you can consider:

- Remove the cap of 4.
- *All* enemies get up to four soulblaze stacks, not a stack of 4 shared equally to 4 enemies, meaning everyone gets 1 stack, aka almost no damage. 
- A general rework to work more with other staffs except Inferno + Trauma+Blessing. Right half of this talent line is for melee, so the other half could be generic staff talents perhaps?

Long story short, I’ve known this dude for 15 years… he’s always been a little flakey but we’ve been friends forever… when he lost everything I gave him a place to sleep and live, I literally didn’t charge him a cent until he figured his life out and moved out. 

I, like many others, lost my home in the LA wildfires. You can’t even imagine how fucking terrible this has been for so many of us. I’ve literally been in tears most days… I have nothing except a car and some clothes… I’ve only been staying on his fucking couch for less than 2 weeks, but he has zero awareness.. suddenly it’s 3 fucking weeks, and now there’s a mystery girl who has priority. I’m just sad man. This dude was my friend. I feel betrayed. 

Am I overreacting here or am I in the right to be absolutely pissed and want to remove him permanently from my life after this ?",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iazjin,2025-01-27 04:14:26,64028

Don't like using shield either lol

I hate the fact the best form of a physical damage for cyclone and have good survivability is using a staff and use shockwave. Spinning and hitting people with a big stick just doesn't do it for me.

Reddit,cyclone,Cyclone Shockwave Slayer - Bloodline Ascendancy thoughts?,"Hey all. I am going to be rolling a Cyclone Shockwave Slayer this league in SSF.

I was looking at the bloodlines and was wondering if there's anything looking good there for this class?

I was thinking that maybe losing Impact (AOE, dmg, accuracy) might be worth it in favor of the Delirious Bloodline. Specifically taking the Schizophrenia Dissociation node, which provides a whole **40% less damage taken from hits**.

The damage instead comes during the next 4 seconds. Which should be mitigated easily with the great life leech the build has.

My thinking is that both AOE, 15% damage, and accuracy are all nice to have, but nothing more. While 40% less damage taken from most damage sources is just huge.

There's also the downside of no Jewel effects. But in my experience it takes a very long time to have good Jewels in SSF.

Reddit,volcano,Volcano Is Not Malware,"Keep in mind that following people's verdicts without any proof from them, and/or making your own verdict without explanation is stupid. Listen to your teachers, kids.

**Clearing Some Information**

**1. Does Volcano log my information?**  
No. Volcano does not in anyway log your personal information. Anybody saying it does is fabricated. I can prove this with a few points.

* Refer To Image 1: **12 to 12** (or dsds) was the original person providing statements that Volcano accessed your webcam upon external analysis. dsds however did not say that Volcano itself was malicious, or log information. The only people saying it did infact log information lied.
* Virustotal and Triage Scan: Using these two websites, we can identify that the only websites that Volcano accesses is [file.volcano.wtf](http://file.volcano.wtf), with the only purpose to get the Version file. This completely debunks the accusation of ""Volcano sending information to a remote server"" or ""Quietly collect your personal information"".
* WhatExploitsAreOnline: WEAO staff stated that the information may just be anti-debug, and even said that to stop calling Volcano malware.

**2. Whats with the Camera thing?**  
Volcano accessing your camera is likely just an anti-debug. Do you hear the whistle? We don't know for certain if this ""camera-flashing"" only happens for specific users. I can't completely defend Volcano though, because if this is an actual anti-tamper feature, that's immoral.

* Shouldn't this be associated with like, viruses and stuff?: No. Why would the camera only flash given only if debugged with a tool? If Volcano were malware, It would flash during regular usage, not just for people purposefully debugging it. This is also completely debunked by the 1st and 2nd point in Question 1.

That's really all I have to say, since no actual image or video proof was provided. Everything is based on hearsay and the points I have to debunk are very stale.
